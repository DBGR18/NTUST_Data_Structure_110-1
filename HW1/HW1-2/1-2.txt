Answer decryption
Description

Professor Chen sent the midterm exam answers to Hank, the TA. 
To prevent leakage, he encrypted the message with a secret algorithm. 
To decrypt the cypher, Hank needs to use the following rules:

n[s] will be decrypted as s repeated n times. n∈[1,300]. s only consists of 
ASCII lowercase English letters.
The symbol<means to swap its neighbor elements(a single character or a n[s] block).
E.g. 2[apple]<2[cat] ->catcatappleapple, hi<2[oh]->hohohi
The symbol<has greater precedence thann[s],
which means 1[apple]<2[cat] can be transformed into 2[cat]1[apple]
The symbol<has left-associative.
E.g. 2[apple]<2[cat]<2[dog]->2[cat]2[apple]<2[dog]->2[cat]2[dog]2[apple]
The inputs are always correct, you don't need to deal with the error case
Please write a program to decrypt the cypher.

Constraints:

Do not use any libraries (vector, queue, stack…) 
except for standard I/O and string(only allowed in HW1-2). 
Please implement your own stack or queue using array if you needed.

TAs will manually check your code after the deadline.


Input
In each test case, there are several lines of input cypher string C
C consists of ASCII lowercase English letters, digits, '[' and ']' and '<'

1 ≤ ∣C∣ ≤ 70
For the operation n[s] in C, n∈[1,300]

Output
For each input, please show the decrypted message.
