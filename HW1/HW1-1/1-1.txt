Shortest path of Maze
Description

After 魯拉拉 was acknowledged that 瓦基 took almost half of the flour, he felt he was tricked and betrayed.
"No one can treat me as a fool!!" said 魯拉拉. He then ask his housekeepers to chase 瓦基 before he escape. 
There are several rooms and aisles in 魯拉拉's house. 
In order to leave the house as soon as possible, 瓦基 needs to find the shortest path.

瓦基 got a map of 魯拉拉's house from a kind housekeeper.

The size of map is N \times MN×M and represented by 4 kinds symbols(his current location, walls, aisles, and the door).
瓦基 can only move up, down, left and right.
Please help him to find out the number of "how many moves of shortest path" from his current location to the door.

Constraints:

Do not use any libraries (vector, queue, stack…) except for standard I/O. 
Please implement your own stack or queue using array if you needed.

TAs will manually check your code after the deadline.


Input
Each test case contains several inputs,each of which represents a maze. 
The first line of an input contains two positive integer NN, MM, which means the number of rows and columns of the map, 
where 1 \leq M, N \leq 1001≤M,N≤100. The next NN lines contains MM symbols which represent the map.

.represents his current location
#represents the wall
*represents the aisles he can go through
@represents the door

Output
For test case, please help him to find out the number of  
"how many moves of shortest path" from his current location to the door.
